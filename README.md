Week Three Project of iOS Bootcamp

Hi Sean,
For when you finish the parent/child app.

First do the simple table view app. There is a readme file that explains what to do.

Once you have complete that and understand it, check out the navctrl app. It also has a readme file that explains what you need to do.

Thanks,
Oren
